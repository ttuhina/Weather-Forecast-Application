## WEATHER INFORMATION AGGREGATOR

This project fetches current weather and 5-day forecast data for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The original callback-based code has been refactored to use Promises and Async/Await for improved readability and error handling.

Files : 

1. weather-using-async.js -
The main script file that orchestrates the fetching of weather and forecast data using Async/Await. It handles API requests to OpenWeatherMap, combines the data, and saves it to weatherData.json.

2. c.js -
Configuration file that stores the OpenWeatherMap API key, the city for which weather data is fetched, and the API URLs.

3. package.json -
Metadata file that includes project dependencies (axios) and npm commands to run the project (npm start).

4. weatherData.json -
Output file generated by the script, containing JSON data with the fetched weather and forecast information for the specified city.
